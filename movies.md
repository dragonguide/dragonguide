<!--
Please sort the movies in the following way:
- For movies that are not part of a series, sort it as [Title] - [Year]. This way, movies sharing the same title will also be sorted accordingly.
- For movies that are part of a series, sort it as [Series Name]- [Entry in that Series] - [Title] - [Year]. For example, DragonHeart: A New Beginning would be sorted as DragonHeart - 2 - DragonHeart: A New Beginning - 2000. This is to prevent movies of the same series from being spread apart.

For movie and TV show information, it is recommended you use The Movie Database (https://www.themoviedb.org/). The overview tends to be well-suited for the description field in the table.

This page serves as an overview of dragon movies. You will find two lists.

- Themed around dragons
These movies prominently feature dragons. The characters are predominantly dragons, or a dragon is a main character, and dragons play a crucial part in the plot.

- Featuring dragons
These movies feature dragons, but they are not critical to the plot. They tend to serve as one of the friends or foes of a main character, or are only mentioned or shown in passing.

Crossing a line is difficult, so we are considering adopting a different system, or merging these lists in case we fail too. We are also considering adding TV shows in the future (for now though, The Dragon Price, Dragon Goes House-Hunting and House of the Dragon would be some of my recommendations).
