# alt.fan.dragons
alt.fan.dragons, also known as Alfandria, The Dominance or simply AFD, is a Usenet news group open to discussions, opinions and literature about dragons. As an unmoderated forum, rather than enforcing a certain mindset, users are enouraged to freely put forth their own opinions, views and ideas. The news group was created on December 1<sup>st</sup>, 1993 by ExistingPhantom.

## History
The original purprose of the newsgroup was to have technical discussions on dragons, including topics such as how they possibly would behave, real life legends and posting poems. After polling for interest in adjacent fantasy news groups, he submitted a proposal to create the alt.fan.dragons Usenet newsgroup, an original copy of which can be found below.

```
Proposal / Request For Discussion 
New Newsgroup ALT.FAN.DRAGONS 
Status: Unmoderated

This is a formal Proposal and Request for Discussion for the creation of
a new newsgroup under alt.fan.dragons or alt.dragons.

CHARTER - alt.fan.dragons

Alt.fan.dragons will be an unmoderated forum for the posting of any and
all topics relating to dragons, as well as opinion, discussion, stories,
poetry and pictures about any aspect of dragons. The discussion will not
be restricted to any single author or individual's views on dragons life
cycles or behavior, but will be a free discussions on any aspect or ideas
put forth about them.

Topics could include:

*  Discussion on dragon life cycles, Social organization, behavior,
   Characteristics, legends, art styles and other aspects. 
*  Discussions regarding specific authors ideas of dragons 
*  Any original ideas, stories or poems. 
*  Anything else that is relevant to dragons in general.

RATIONALE:

The net has a lot of people interested in dragons on it. A look at
a.b.p.m, a.f.p and a?? traffic level will confirm that. There is
currently no single group on Usenet which addresses the proposed subject
matter. I feel that this group will be successful and help consolidate
the multiple interest in dragons that is scattered around various
newsgroups and yet restricted from full discussion by the various
newsgroup's topic restrictions.

In a recent poll it see if there was any interest for the creation of
such a group out of 54 people who responded 53 expressed interest in
having such a group created. The poll was put out on 11/17/93. The
results were compiled on 11/22/93. The poll was posted to the following
groups:

NAMESPACE

I am not in any way committed to the choice of group name.  I am also
considering the name alt.dragons. However a.t.fan.dragons is probably the
best name due to the existence of alt.dragons-inn which is a story/roll
playing environment and we wouldn't ant any postings confused between the
groups. Any other suggestions would be appreciated.


Suggested one line description for the List of Active Newsgroups:
alt.fan.dragons:       - A discussion on all aspects of dragons.


PROCESS:

The normal  group creation guidelines will be followed.  Discussion will
continue for 30 days from this posting, and after that, a Call for Votes
(CFV) will be posted if appropriate.


DISCUSSION:

Discussion of the proposed group should be held on alt.config. Note that
the Followup-To: line of this article will direct any followups to
alt.config automatically.

Feel free to re-post this article to other newsgroups or mailing-lists
whose readers might find it of interest, as long as the Followup-To: line
remains directed to alt.config. All discussion should take place in that
newsgroup.

I welcome anyone who wishes to write to me personally as well. I hope
this group will be successful.
```

The news group received a few posts a week for the first several months of its existance. These indeed tended to moee technical discussions, as was originally intended. However, nearing the end of 1994, posts from users claiming to be dragons started appearing. Discussions also became less technical, much to the dismay of ExistingPhantom. Fearing that this would cause the group to dry up and die off, the creator tempted to steer topics into a more technical direction, until noticing that the amount of posts per week jumped from only a few to dozens. From this point, alt.fan.dragons blossomed into a community of its own, well beyond a technical discussion group.

## Accessing the news group
Due to the advancement of technology, it has become increasingly more difficult to make use of Usenet, as it is nowadays considered an obsolete. Nevertheless, with technical know-how, it can still be accessed.

Setting up Usenet can be likened to setting up e-mail in a traditional desktop client, such as Outlook. You need to choose a client, a server and make sure you have created an account on that server before you can start making use of the service.

### Choosing a news reader
A news reader is a piece of software (client) that allows your device access Usenet news groups. Below, a few options for various platforms are listed.

* [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
An e-mail client from the people behind the well-known Mozilla Firefox web browser that also happens to support Usenet news groups. It's available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
* [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org)
A GTK+ e-mail client and news reader known for its robustness and light-weight interface. Available for both Linux and Windows.
* [NewsTap](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-usenet-newsreader/id292410356)
A [lite version](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-lite-usenet-reader/id297063247) of the app is available for free, whereas the full version needs to be purchased. Available for iOS and iPadOS in the App Store.
* [Xnews](https://web.archive.org/web/20141227184804/http://xnews.newsguy.com/)
Albeit discontinued, still a very much appreciated client that will likely continue to work for the forseeable future. Only available for Windows.
* [Newsgrouper](https://cmacleod.me.uk/ng/alt.fan.dragons)
Allows free access to Usenet newsgroups from a web browser. You can browse as a guest, but posting requires you to sign up for an account.

[Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.fan.dragons) used to be the easiest way to access alt.fan.dragons, requiring only a web browser and a Google account. However, Google has discontinued its integration with Usenet, meaning it is no longer possible to send and receive new posts. Currently, it is only possible to view historical posts from before February 22, 2024.

### Choosing a Usenet server
Below, we provide you with a list of Usenet servers to choose from. If you decide to look for one yourself online, be warned that hosting providers tend to offer mostly "binary" Usenet servers. These kinds of servers are meant for sharing files over Usenet, rather than participating in newsgroups.

* [Eternal-September](https://www.eternal-september.org)
Named after the [Usenet slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), Eternal-September is a private project providing free news group access to anyone who creates an account.
* [Individual.NET](https://individual.net)
A Usenet server offered by the Freie Universität Berlin, which can be used for a low yearly fee.

As an alternative, you may also contact your ISP, as many of them may provide a Usenet server of their own.

### Configuring your client
Depending on the client of choice, configuring Usenet is going to work differently. It would be impossible to list instructions for each client, so only instructions for Thunderbird will be shown here. Please consult instructions, tutorials, guides or manuals elsewhere if you need help with a different client.

1. If not already shown, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> to display the menu bar. Then, select File → New → Other Accounts.
2. Select Newsgroup Account and click Next/Continue.
3. Enter your name and email account. When you send a message to a newsgroup, these values will be used to identify the source of the message. Click Next/Continue.
4. Enter the address of the newsgroup server that you are subscribing to. In this case, alt.fan.dragons. Then, click Next/Continue.
5. Enter a name for the account and click Next/Continue.
6. You will be presented with a summary screen. Verify that all the information you entered is correct and click Finish/Done, or click Back to edit the incorrect information. 

Once you have configured a newsgroup server, right-click the account name in the folder pane and select Subscribe to specify the groups that you want to join. To modify other account settings, right-click the account name in the folder pane and select Settings. You can customize various settings, such as the frequency and amount of downloaded messages, composition options, etc.

## Dragonfire.org
Dragonfire.org was generally considered to be the official site of alt.fan.dragons. It boasted general info about the Usenet forum, as well as provide additonal content like games, literature, entertainment, art and photos. It encouraged new users to join the community by providing an FAQ (a list of frequently asked questions).

The last modification appears to have been made in April of 2010, after which the site has reportedly remained online until at least September, 2015. The website has since then been taken offline. Attempting to visit the site now at its original address, [http://dragonfire.org](http://dragonfire.org), most likely results in server connectivity-related error messages. Whilst the website is no longer online, an archived version made in May of 2015 can be accessed using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150521031857/http://www.dragonfire.org/).
