# An introduction to draconity and dragonkin
Draconity refers to the state or condition of identifying as a dragon, though it can also refer to the subculture and community surrounding it. Someone who identifies as a dragon is often referred to as a "dragonkin". Draconity encompasses the various ways in which people experience and express their dragon identity. It can be considered a core aspect of an individual's identity, influencing their beliefs, behaviors, and perceptions. Whilst many dragonkin share similar beliefs, quite rarely is one universal. However, a connection to something dragon in nature is usually shared by all. This connection can be spiritual, psychological or both.

## Identity
What it means to identify as a dragon, is hard to define due to several reasons. Firstly, the term "dragon" is rather ambigeous. Some well known dragons include the western dragon and the eastern dragon. The former tends to be depicted as a big, winged reptile, and is known for guarding great treasure and testing a hero's strength. The latter, meanwhile, tends to be long and serpentine, a physicial amalgamation of several different kinds of creatures, associated with the powers of nature. Dragons come in many more shapes and forms besides these two, however. Think of serpents, wyverns, amphipteres and wyrms to only name a few. Secondly, an identity is something very personal, so it is going to be very different from everybody. Not just what kind of dragon they are, but the nature of their connection to dragons as well. 

## History
<!-- The history of otherkin, not just dragonkin, should be included as well! -->

The term "dragonkin" was first used on the internet in the mid-1990s, in particular on [Usenet newsgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) such as alt.fan.dragons and [IRC chat groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). During this time, these groups saw a rampent influx of new members identifying themselves as dragon. It is thought that the growing popularity of role-playing (video) games, as well as depictions of dragons in media getting more common, are related. The increasing accessibility of the internet, making it easier than ever for like-minded people to meet up and form communities, might also be a contributing factor. The sudden, rapid growth of these groups and communies was cause for concern amonst some older dragonkin members who feared many newcommers merely pretended to be dragon, discrediting genuine dragons.

Nowadays, with technologies such as Usenet and IRC no longer in fasion and with the introducton of the World Wide Web, communities surrounding draconity have been largely scattered, with most people having moved on to individually-hosted forums and central chat platforms such as Discord and Telegram.
