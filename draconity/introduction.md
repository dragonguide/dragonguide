# An introduction to draconity and dragonkin
Draconity refers to the state or condition of identifying as a dragon, though it can also refer to the subculture and community surrounding it. Someone who identifies as a dragon is often referred to as a dragonkin, or sometimes simply as a dragon. Draconity encompasses the various ways in which people experience and express their dragon identity. It can be considered a core aspect of an individual's identity, influencing their beliefs, behaviors, and perceptions. Whilst many dragonkin share similar beliefs, quite rarely is one universal. However, a connection to something dragon in nature is usually shared by all. This connection can be spiritual, psychological or both.

## Identity
What it means to identify as a dragon is hard to define due to several reasons. Firstly, the term "dragon" is rather ambigeous. Some well known kinds of dragon include the western dragon and the eastern dragon, but then there are serpents, wyverns, amphipteres and wyrms to only name a few. Secondly, an identity is something very personal, so it is going to be very different from everybody. Not just what kind of dragon they are, but the nature of their connection to dragons as well. Because of these reasons, we can only really talk about what a dragon identity is in general, but not what it would be in every case and according to everybody. Keep that in the back of your mind as you continue reading.

Dragonkin believe in their draconity as a statement of identity, similar to how one might identify with a nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. There are several reasons why people come to identiy as a dragon, and they can be both spiritual as well as psychological in nature. Many dragonkin believe they possess the spirit or essence of a dragon. This belief might stem from feelings of having lived past lives as dragons or a profound spiritual kinship with dragons. Spiritual practices, such as meditation, astral projection, and rituals, are often employed to connect with their dragon essence. For others, identifying as a dragon is an integral part of their psychological makeup. This means they may think, feel, and behave in ways they associate with being a dragon. Some dragonkin also experience their dragon identity through metaphysical phenomena. This can include feeling [phantom limbs](/phantom-limbs) (such as wings or a tail), experiencing shifts where they feel more dragon-like, or having vivid dreams and visions of being a dragon.

<!-- Dragons do not consider themselves superior to humans, nor do they think they are not a human physically. Instead, they see their identity as better fitting for themselves while appreciating human life. The choice of identifying with a creature not physically proven to exist is a matter of faith, akin to religious or philosophical beliefs. The prevalence of dragons in various mythologies supports their symbolic significance. The importance of draconity to those who embrace it is profound and personal. -->

A pivotal moment or series of experiences where an individual begins to recognize and embrace their identity as a dragon or their connection to dragons on a deeper level, is called an awakening. This process is highly personal and can vary widely in its nature and intensity from person to person. An awakening can happen at any stage in life, multiple times or not at all. In case it happens multiple times, someone might have lost the connection with their dragon side only to find it again at a later point in life. Meanwhile, someone who identifies as a dragon but has never had an awakening might have always considered themselves a dragon for as long as they can remember.

<!-- The psychological basis of draconity is often questioned. While it is a unique belief, it is not indicative of mental instability. The journey to embrace draconity involves confronting many doubts and often requires high self-esteem and inner peace. Acceptance by others varies, but it ultimately depends on individual perception and willingness to listen. Draconity is not escapism; rather, it involves a significant mental struggle and a commitment to understanding oneself. -->

## History
<!-- The history of otherkin, not just dragonkin, should be included as well! -->

The term "dragonkin" was first used on the internet in the mid-1990s, in particular on [Usenet newsgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup) such as alt.fan.dragons and [IRC chat groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat). During this time, these groups saw a rampent influx of new members identifying themselves as dragon. It is thought that the growing popularity of role-playing (video) games, as well as depictions of dragons in media getting more common, are related. The increasing accessibility of the internet, making it easier than ever for like-minded people to meet up and form communities, might also be a contributing factor. The sudden, rapid growth of these groups and communies was cause for concern amonst some older dragonkin members who feared many newcommers merely pretended to be dragon, discrediting genuine dragons.

Nowadays, with technologies such as Usenet and IRC no longer in fasion and with the introducton of the World Wide Web, communities surrounding draconity have been largely scattered, with most people having moved on to individually-hosted forums and central chat platforms such as Discord and Telegram.

Introduction to Draconity

Draconity, a concept where individuals identify with or as dragons, varies widely among those who embrace it. This exploration is an attempt to address various aspects of draconity, helping those coming to terms with their own draconity or those concerned about a friend or relative. The information here is based on the work "I am Dragon" by Baxil, and it's important to consider this as a guide rather than definitive answers.

Understanding Draconity

Dragons, mythic creatures found in legends across civilizations, are central to draconity. Western dragons are often depicted as reptilian guardians of treasure or challenges for heroes, while Eastern dragons are seen as amalgamations of various creatures and associated with nature's powers. Other types of dragons include sea serpents, wyverns, amphipteres, and wyrms. Identifying as a dragon signifies acknowledging dragons as an integral part of one's life, whether as a social group, a self-perception, or a worldview. This identity varies from person to person; some draw strength from it in everyday life, while others keep it private.

The psychological basis of draconity is often questioned. While it is a unique belief, it is not indicative of mental instability. The journey to embrace draconity involves confronting many doubts and often requires high self-esteem and inner peace. Acceptance by others varies, but it ultimately depends on individual perception and willingness to listen. Draconity is not escapism; rather, it involves a significant mental struggle and a commitment to understanding oneself.

Beliefs and Identity

Dragons believe in their draconity as a statement of identity, similar to how one might identify with a nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. This identity can be spiritual, where individuals connect with the essence of dragons, or belief in past lives as dragons. Determining if one is a dragon involves introspection and a deep understanding of oneself, rather than external validation. Some people feel spiritually connected to dragons or have an internal avatar representing their draconic side.

Dragons do not consider themselves superior to humans. Instead, they see their identity as better fitting for themselves while appreciating human life. The choice of identifying with a creature not physically proven to exist is a matter of faith, akin to religious or philosophical beliefs. The prevalence of dragons in various mythologies supports their symbolic significance. The importance of draconity to those who embrace it is profound and personal.

Names and Perceptions

Many dragons use a dragon name different from their human one, as it is a direct way to affirm their identity. Refusing to use this name can be seen as disrespectful. Dragons do not have a unified stance on various issues, reflecting their diverse and individualistic nature. In real life, dragons come from all walks of life, span various ages, and are widely geographically distributed. They tend to be introspective, often feeling social detachment from an early age, and are usually well-educated or bright underachievers. Draconity is not gender-specific, although males may outnumber females online. Dragons typically enjoy reading, particularly fantasy and science fiction.

Draconity and Religion

Draconity is not a cult. It lacks a charismatic leader, unconditional dogma, and financial demands typical of cults. The dragon community is inclusive, with intellectual and social conversations, and non-dragons are always welcome. There is no organized effort to recruit members, and social pressure is absent. Draconity, therefore, is not a religion. It has no fixed dogma, rituals, or necessary ethics, making it compatible with existing religious beliefs unless those beliefs inherently conflict with the concept of dragons.

Community and Social Aspects

Becoming a dragon is not a matter of choice but of self-discovery. True draconity is about realizing one's inherent identity rather than adopting a new one. Joining the dragon community is open to everyone, regardless of their identity. The community, primarily online due to the geographical dispersion of its members, provides a platform for connection and support. The internet amplifies the visibility of nonstandard beliefs, allowing dragons to find and interact with each other more easily. Dragons spend significant time online because it feels like a place of understanding and acceptance.

The dragon community is diverse, including humans, wolves, gryphons, shapeshifters, and more. Not everyone in the community is a dragon, and distinguishing between true dragons and pretenders involves understanding the earnestness and staying power of individuals. Familiarity with the community helps in recognizing genuine draconity. The online presence of the dragon community, supported by forums and social media, provides a central gathering place for those who identify as dragons, facilitating a sense of belonging and mutual support.
