# alt.fan.dragons
alt.fan.dragons, also known as Alfandria, The Dominance or simply AFD, is a Usenet news group open to discussions, opinions and literature about dragons. As an unmoderated forum, rather than enforcing a certain mindset, users are enouraged to freely put forth their own opinions, views and ideas. The news group was created on December 1<sup>st</sup>, 1993 by ExistingPhantom.
 
## Accessing the news group
 
Due to the advancement of technology, it has become increasingly more difficult to make use of Usenet, as it is nowadays considered an obsolete. Nevertheless, with technical know-how, it can still be accessed.

Setting up Usenet can be likened to setting up e-mail in a traditional desktop client, such as Outlook. You need to choose a client, a server and make sure you have created an account on that server before you can start making use of the service.

### Choosing a news reader
A news reader is a piece of software (client) that allows your device access Usenet news groups. Below, a few options for various platforms are listed.

* [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
An e-mail client from the people behind the well-known Mozilla Firefox web browser that also happens to support Usenet news groups. It's available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
* [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org)
A GTK+ e-mail client and news reader known for its robustness and light-weight interface. Available for both Linux and Windows.
* [NewsTap](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-usenet-newsreader/id292410356)
A [lite version](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-lite-usenet-reader/id297063247) of the app is available for free, whereas the full version needs to be purchased. Available for iOS and iPadOS in the App Store.
* [Xnews](https://web.archive.org/web/20141227184804/http://xnews.newsguy.com/)
Albeit discontinued, still a very much appreciated client that will likely continue to work for the forseeable future. Only available for Windows.

[Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.fan.dragons) used to be the easiest way to access alt.fan.dragons, requiring only a web browser and a Google account. However, Google has discontinued its integration with Usenet, meaning it is no longer possible to send and receive new posts. Currently, it is only possible to view historical posts from before February 22, 2024.

### Choosing a Usenet server
Below, we provide you with a list of Usenet servers to choose from. If you decide to look for one yourself online, be warned that hosting providers tend to offer mostly "binary" Usenet servers. These kinds of servers are meant for sharing files over Usenet, rather than participating in newsgroups.

* [Eternal-September](https://www.eternal-september.org)
Named after the [Usenet slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), Eternal-September is a private project providing free news group access to anyone who creates an account.
* [Individual.NET](https://individual.net)
A Usenet server offered by the Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, which can be used for a low yearly fee.

As an alternative, you may also contact your ISP, as many of them may provide a Usenet server of their own.

Proposal / Request For Discussion 
New Newsgroup ALT.FAN.DRAGONS 
Status: Unmoderated

This is a formal Proposal and Request for Discussion for the creation of
a new newsgroup under alt.fan.dragons or alt.dragons.

CHARTER - alt.fan.dragons

Alt.fan.dragons will be an unmoderated forum for the posting of any and
all topics relating to dragons, as well as opinion, discussion, stories,
poetry and pictures about any aspect of dragons. The discussion will not
be restricted to any single author or individual's views on dragons life
cycles or behavior, but will be a free discussions on any aspect or ideas
put forth about them.

Topics could include:

*  Discussion on dragon life cycles, Social organization, behavior,
   Characteristics, legends, art styles and other aspects. 
*  Discussions regarding specific authors ideas of dragons 
*  Any original ideas, stories or poems. 
*  Anything else that is relevant to dragons in general.

RATIONALE:

The net has a lot of people interested in dragons on it. A look at
a.b.p.m, a.f.p and a?? traffic level will confirm that. There is
currently no single group on Usenet which addresses the proposed subject
matter. I feel that this group will be successful and help consolidate
the multiple interest in dragons that is scattered around various
newsgroups and yet restricted from full discussion by the various
newsgroup's topic restrictions.

In a recent poll it see if there was any interest for the creation of
such a group out of 54 people who responded 53 expressed interest in
having such a group created. The poll was put out on 11/17/93. The
results were compiled on 11/22/93. The poll was posted to the following
groups:

NAMESPACE

I am not in any way committed to the choice of group name.  I am also
considering the name alt.dragons. However a.t.fan.dragons is probably the
best name due to the existence of alt.dragons-inn which is a story/roll
playing environment and we wouldn't ant any postings confused between the
groups. Any other suggestions would be appreciated.


Suggested one line description for the List of Active Newsgroups:
alt.fan.dragons:       - A discussion on all aspects of dragons.


PROCESS:

The normal  group creation guidelines will be followed.  Discussion will
continue for 30 days from this posting, and after that, a Call for Votes
(CFV) will be posted if appropriate.


DISCUSSION:

Discussion of the proposed group should be held on alt.config. Note that
the Followup-To: line of this article will direct any followups to
alt.config automatically.

Feel free to re-post this article to other newsgroups or mailing-lists
whose readers might find it of interest, as long as the Followup-To: line
remains directed to alt.config. All discussion should take place in that
newsgroup.

I welcome anyone who wishes to write to me personally as well. I hope
this group will be successful.

Back in 1992 before the existence of the world wide web when all that internet junkies had too keep themselves entertained were e-mail, telent, ftp sites, golpher (just starting to appear) listserves, usenet news and the occasion game of Empire or Imorea. I was (and still am) a big dragon fan who loved collecting anything with dragons in it. Trouble was, that dragon info and images were few and very hard to find on the internet at that time. Search engines were in their infancy and could only search on file names of ftp sites. You were lucky to find a new dragon resource (usually a single gif image) once every three months. I began to pull all the dragon files I found in to one ftp site called icecube. Thus the first strictly dragon internet resource was born. Not very many people knew about it or used it but that was ok. Being a starving dragon fan in a dragonless internet, I wondered if there were any other dragon fans out there. So I started posting to the Usenet fantasy groups asking if there was any interest in creating a dragon related Usenet news group. To my surprise, over several months I received seven replies back stating interest. So I started the newsgroup creation process:

Alt.fan.dragons is an unmoderated forum for the posting of any and all topics relating to dragons, as well as opinion, discussion, stories and poetry about any aspect of dragons. The discussion is not restricted to any single author's or individual's views on dragons' life-cycles or behavior, but is a free discussion on any aspect or ideas put forth about them.

AFD came into being on December 1st of 1993. The first two months alt.fan.dragons received about 3 posts a week. There were no dragon in the group then. It contained mostly technical discussions, with an occasion poem. Around July of 1994 things started picking up. We were getting 7 to 10 posts a week. Then September - November rolled around and this guy called Blackburn and several others started showing up and started claiming they were dragons.

Before then AFD was mainly a technical discussion group. What most people do not know is that I was fearful that such semi-off-topic, (though not too off topic if you read the above description) posts would cause the few people we had posting to the group to stop posting and that the group would dry up and die off. I tried to discourage such posts, by trying to change the topic back to technical discussions.

I failed miserably.

For two and a half months I tried changing the topic to technical discussion. The first month I was so-so successful, the second month there were pies being thrown everywhere and no one was getting into any technical discussion, halfway through the third month a light bulb swung and hit me up side the head. In July we were getting 7 posts a week now in December ( 1 year after it started) we were getting 15 to 20 posts a day. Everyone was enjoying them selves and having fun, there weren't any flame feasts going on, AFD was growing in population quickly and wasn't going to die off as an unused news groups. I saw the title wave (of delicious cream pies) rising before me and decided to stop trying to swing against it and just surf with the flow.

Shortly there after Dalnet was created by Dalvenjah FoxFire (aka Sven Nielsen), the World Wide Web sprouted into being and the wonderful world of AFD bloomed like a wild fire. The land of AFD was first called the Dominance, then someone came of with the wonderful term Alfandra and it has stuck like peanut butter in a banana pie ever since.

I haven't been active with the newsgroup in quite a while. The reason has as nothing to do with any of the above. I'm still as big a dragon fan as I ever was. However, I no longer have time I use to read a.f.d on a regular basis, but I do pop in every 6 months or so to see what's happening. I miss you guys *grouf!*

This is the history as I am aware in a nutshell. Thus spake the ol'frute. 

## Dragonfire.org
Dragonfire.org was generally considered to be the official site of alt.fan.dragons. It boasted general info about the Usenet forum, as well as provide additonal content like games, literature, entertainment, art and photos. It encouraged new users to join the community by providing an FAQ (a list of frequently asked questions).

The last modification appears to have been made in April of 2010, after which the site has reportedly remained online until at least September, 2015. The website has since then been taken offline. Attempting to visit the site now at its original address, [http://dragonfire.org](http://dragonfire.org), most likely results in server connectivity-related error messages. Whilst the website is no longer online, an archived version made in May of 2015 can be accessed using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150521031857/http://www.dragonfire.org/).
