# alt.fan.dragons
alt.fan.dragons is a Usenet news group open to discussions, opinions and literature about dragons. As an unmoderated forum, rather than enforcing a certain mindset, users are enouraged to freely put forth their own opinions, views and ideas. The news group was created on December 1<sup>st</sup>, 1993 by ExistingPhantom.
 
## Accessing the news group
 
Due to the advancement of technology, it has become increasingly more difficult to make use of Usenet, as it is nowadays considered an obsolete. Nevertheless, with technical know-how, it can still be accessed.

Setting up Usenet can be likened to setting up e-mail in a traditional desktop client, such as Outlook. You need to choose a client, a server and make sure you have created an account on that server before you can start making use of the service.

### Choosing a news reader
A news reader is a piece of software (client) that allows your device access Usenet news groups. Below, a few options for various platforms are listed.

* [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)
An e-mail client from the people behind the well-known Mozilla Firefox web browser that also happens to support Usenet news groups. It's available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
* [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org)
A GTK+ e-mail client and news reader known for its robustness and light-weight interface. Available for both Linux and Windows.
* [NewsTap](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-usenet-newsreader/id292410356)
A [lite version](https://apps.apple.com/app/newstap-lite-usenet-reader/id297063247) of the app is available for free, whereas the full version needs to be purchased. Available for iOS and iPadOS in the App Store.
* [Xnews](https://web.archive.org/web/20141227184804/http://xnews.newsguy.com/)
Albeit discontinued, still a very much appreciated client that will likely continue to work for the forseeable future. Only available for Windows.

[Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/alt.fan.dragons) used to be the easiest way to access alt.fan.dragons, requiring only a web browser and a Google account. However, Google has discontinued its integration with Usenet, meaning it is no longer possible to send and receive new posts. Currently, it is only possible to view historical posts from before February 22, 2024.

## Choosing a Usenet server
Below, we provide you with a list of Usenet servers to choose from. If you decide to look for one yourself online, be warned that hosting providers tend to offer mostly "binary" Usenet servers. These kinds of servers are meant for sharing files over Usenet, rather than participating in newsgroups.

* [Eternal-September](https://www.eternal-september.org)
Named after the Usenet slang, Eternal-September is a private project providing free news group access to anyone who creates an account.
* [Individual.NET](https://individual.net)
A Usenet server offered by the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, which can be used for a low yearly fee.

As an alternative, you may also contact your ISP, as many of them may provide a Usenet server of their own.

## Dragonfire.org
Dragonfire.org was generally considered to be the official site of alt.fan.dragons. It boasted general info about the Usenet forum, as well as provide additonal content like games, literature, entertainment, art and photos. It encouraged new users to join the community by providing an FAQ (a list of frequently asked questions).

The last modification appears to have been made in April of 2010, after which the site has reportedly remained online until at least September, 2015. The website has since then been taken offline. Attempting to visit the site now at its original address, [http://dragonfire.org](http://dragonfire.org), most likely results in server connectivity-related error messages. Whilst the website is no longer online, an archived version made in May of 2015 can be accessed using the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150521031857/http://www.dragonfire.org/).
