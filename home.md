# Welcome to Dragon Guide
We aim to be a repository of information to the dragonkin community. Our goal is to set outselves apart in the following ways.

- [A community-guided website to which anyone can contribute.](/contributing)
- [A resilliant "hydra" artictecture to ensure our repository will stay around for decades to come.](/hydra-architecture)
- A modern, easy-to-navigate interface to help you find the things you need.
- A safe space to document and share your personal draconic experiences.

We are currently working on setting up the site, and adding as much content as possible. Contributions would very much be appreciated!

## Contact
