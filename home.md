# Welcome to Dragon Guide
We aim to be a repository of information to the dragonkin community. Our goal is to set outselves apart in the following ways.

- [A community-guided website to which anyone can contribute.](/contributing)
- [A resilliant "hydra" strategy to ensure our repository will stay around for decades to come.](/resiliency)
- A modern, easy-to-navigate interface to help you find the things you need.
- A safe space to document and share your personal draconic experiences.

We are currently working on setting up the site, and adding as much content as possible. Contributions would very much be appreciated!

## Tasks
Before publically announcing this site, there are several things that still need to be done.

- [ ] Expand the site to include all the basic topics on draconity.
- [ ] Ask permission where needed for content and images that are currently on the website.
- [ ] Ask people pre-launch for any contributions and feedback.
- [ ] Discuss and decide on a license for the content on the website.

## Contact
For any inqueries, you may contact us by sending a mail to `contact@[domain of this website]`.  We aim to respond in 1 to 2 days.
