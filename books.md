# List of dragon books
This page serves as an overview of dragon books. You will find four lists.

- Written by dragonkin
These books feature dragons and have been written by people who identify as a dragon.
- Dragon xenofiction
These books are written from the perspective of a dragon.
- Themed around dragons
These books prominently feature dragons. The characters are predominantly dragons, or a dragon is a main character, and dragons play a crucial part in the plot.
- Featuring dragons
These books feature dragons, but they are not critical to the plot. They tend to serve as one of the friends or foes of a main character, or are only mentioned or shown in passing.

Crossing a line is difficult, so we are considering adopting a different system, or merging these lists in case we fail too. We are also considering adding TV shows in the future (for now though, The Dragon Price, Dragon Goes House-Hunting and House of the Dragon would be some of my recommendations).
