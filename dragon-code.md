# About
A Dragon Code is a geek code which reduces the amount of text one would otherwise need to provide a description of what they or their personification are/is. It was created by Red Dragon on January 5, 1995. Eventually, it got taken over by Baxil on August 25, 1996 and by Wyrm on June 19, 1999. While it was created on alt.fan.dragons and widely used within the draconity community, the code is not exclusive to dragons and supports a variety of species.

## Revision

The Revised Dragon Code, also shortened to DC2 or referred to as "Dragon Code 2", is a revised version based upon the original ("Version 1") Dragon Code. It has some differences that are not backwards compatible. All Revised Dragon Codes start with `DC2` instead of `DC`.

# Guide
The code itself consists of a number of tags that represent various characteristics. These tags start with a symbol that indicates what the tag represents, and are followed by other symbols that indicate the strength of (or otherwise modify) that characteristic. The most common modifiers are the + and - symbols, the number of which determines how strong (or weak) that characteristic is.

You can easily identify a Dragon Code from all the other codes. If you encounter an original (version 1) Dragon Code, it will start with `DC.`. Revised Dragon Codes begin with `DC2.` instead. The guide below makes use of the Revised Dragon Code, version 2.6. Below, an example code is shown with a description of the syntax.

<code>DC2.<span style="color: blue">D</span><span style="color: purple">e</span> <span style="color: blue">G<span><span style="color: purple">m</span> <span style="color: blue">L</span> <span style="color: blue">W</span> <span style="color: blue">T</span> <span style="color: blue">P</span><span style="color: purple">hvfwlt</span> <span style="color: blue">Sk</span><span style="color: purple">s</span> <span style="color: blue">C</span><span style="color: purple">bk</span><span style="color: red">\\</span><span style="color: purple">ag</span><span style="color: red">-,</span><span style="color: purple">bgy</span><span style="color: red">,</span><span style="color: purple">vwh</span> <span style="color: blue">B</span><span style="color: magenta">"petrification"</span><span style="color: red">|</span> <span style="color: blue">A</span><span style="color: red">-</span> <span style="color: blue">M</span><span style="color: red">-</span> <span style="color: blue">H</span><span style="color: red">++</span> <span style="color: blue">$</span> <span style="color: blue">Fc</span> <span style="color: blue">J</span> <span style="color: blue">I</span><span style="color: red">--#</span></span> <span style="color: blue">V</span><span style="color: red">+++</span> <span style="color: blue">Tc</span><span style="color: red">+++!</span> <span style="color: blue">E</span><span style="color: red">-</span></code>

* Identifier
The identifier is in the case of the Revised Dragon Code always `DC2.`. This indicates that the code is a Dragon Code and what version of it is.
* Tags
  These describe a single characteristic. They are usually seperated from eachother by spaces. A tag always start with a head group, which could be followed by any sub group, modifier
	* Symbols
	A symbol consists of one or multiple letters and can refer to either a group or a sub group.
		* <span style="color: blue">Groups</span>
  	A tag always begins with a group. A group always starts with a capital letter (e.g. `P`). If a group consists of multiple letters, any following letters will not be capitalised (e.g. `Sk`).
		* <span style="color: purple">Sub group</span>
  	These always follow after a (main) group and serve to provide specification. Depending on the tag, a sub group following after another sub group can mean different things, shown below. For more info, refer to the tag-specific information later in the guide.
			* A sub group of a sub group
			* Another sub group of the (main) group
	* <span style="color: red">Modifier</span>
  A modifier changes or adds additonal definition to a symbol. They often modify or indicate the strength of a charistic. The all modifiers not specific to any tag (tag-specific modifiers are described for each tag's section further into the guide) are listed below.
		* Strength (+/-)
  	Indicates how strong a characteristic is (using `+`) or how weak a characteristic is (using `-`). The stronger or the weaker a characteristic, the more plusses or minusses should be added. The maximum amount of plusses or minusses that can be used is three. To make a characteristic even stronger, add an exclamation mark (`!`) after the three plusses or minusses.
		* Unknown (?)
		This modifier (`?`) indicates that you are unsure or do not know what you are. This is often different from omitting the tag as that can indicate that you don't have that characteristic.
		* Variable
		This modifier (`~`) indicates that you do not have a fixed value for the tag, or that it may vary.
  * <span style="color: magenta">Free text</span>
  There may be areas any options given won't descirbe your case. In these cases, you are free to include any free text in any part of the code. The only requirement is that you put double quotes around any text to distinguish them from other tags.

You can create your own code too by following the instructions below. Whilst you are free to omit tags (except for species), it is recommended to include as many as possible. First off, start your code with `DC2.` and include a species tag right thereafter. It is then recommended to add a space to each following tag you decide to add.

## Species (DC2.\*)
This specific tag must always follow directly after the initial `DC2.` identifier if included. This tag is hierarchical in that the first symbol represents a large group, the next symbol a sub-group of that and so on. Generally, you only need two symbols to describe your species fully.

If your species is not listed, you can write it out long-hand in "double quotes". If your group already exists, put that first and follow it with the species in "double quotes". The list below shows all of the species available.

* D (Dragons)
	* a (Amphiteres)
	* c (Draconids)
	* d (Dragonettes)

---

* H        Humanoids
If you are human, you needn't include any of the sub groups listed below, only the `H` symbol. For those who are humanoid versions of creatures not in the list below, put an H^ before the creature's code. For example, `DC2.H^Dw` is a humanoid which resembles a western dragon.

* ~ (Shapechangers)
This is used to indicate you can change shape. Shapechangers who change between distinct types can include those types after the ~ using a / to seperate the species. For example, `DC2.~Dw/H` would indicate: "I change between a western dragon and human form." It's also quite likely that your distinct forms have differring characteristics as well as similar ones. These can be given directly after the species tag using {} to contain the species specific tags. For example, ``DC2.~Dw{Gf}/H{Gm}A`` would indicate: "I have a western dragon form that is female and a human form that is male, but both are mature adults." If you have a single stable form or a preferred form, you can indicate this by simply specifying that form before the `~`. For example, `DC2.De~` would indicate: "I am an Eastern Dragon who changes shape occasionally." This is subtely different from `DC2.~De` which is: "I am a shapechanger who takes the form of an Eastern Dragon."

### Modifiers
* ? (Unknown)
This is used to indicate you have no idea what you are. One can also use `?` after a group (or sub-group) to indicate that you are uncertain as to what part of the group you are, e.g. `DC2.R?` would indicate: "I am a reptile, but I'm not sure which!"
* ^ (Shaped)
This is used to indicate that you are mainly one form with features of another. For example, `DC2.H^Dw` indicates: "I am humanoid with western dragon features!"
* \[ ] (In another form)
This is used when you are really one type of species, but on the outside you look like another. For example, `DC2.D[H]` indicates: "I am a dragon trapped in human form!" As for shapechangers, you can specify different tags for each species using {} to contain the species specific tags. For example, `DC2.Dw{Gf}[H{Gm}]` would indicate: "I am a female western dragon trapped in a male human body."
* \+ (Crossed)
For example, `DC2.D+H` indicates: "A dragon mated with a human ... and I'm the result!" If you have a cross between species in the same group, you can leave out the second group. For example, `DC2.Dw+p` indicates: "I am a cross between a western and a pernese dragon." You can also have more than two species crossed by adding on more plusses!


## Gender (G*)
One's Gender is something that can influence how others treat you. However there's more to it than just one's physical appearance.
* Gf (Female)
* Gh (Hermaphrodite)
* Gm (Male)
* Gn (Neuter)
* Gp (Pseudo-hermaphrodite)
One who has some characteristics of both male and female, but is not fully hermaphrodite, e.g. feminising testicular syndrome).
* G~ (Variable gender)
If you want to specify the various genders, include them in parenthesis after the `~`. For example, `G~(fm)` indicates: "I vary between female and male."
* G? (Unknown or not applicable)

### Modifiers
* \> (In transition between two types)
You should indicate what you are changing from and to either side of the >. For example, `Gm>n` indicates: "I am a male who is changing to a neuter."
* " " (Other)
If you have a different gender, you can put it after the G in "double quotes". For example, `G"sex"`.
* / (Discrepancy between mental and physical gender)
There are those who want to specify a different mental gender to their physical, in this case you use / to seperate the two with the mental gender going second. For example, `Gm/f` indicates: "I am a female stuck in a male body."


## Length (L*)
Given that there is a collosal variation in size between dragons, dragon friends, and other species, it is important to know just what you're pounce-tackling or snuggle-hugging! You don't want to be accidentally squished after all!

* L+++! (Celestial)
	I hate it when planets get in my mouth when I yawn!
* L+++ (Mistaken for mountain ranges)
	Sorry Mr Battleship, I didn't see you!
* L++  (Can't see own tail on a foggy day)
	Can you say "jungle gym"?
* L+ (Godzilla-sized)
	They look up to me. Literally.
* L (Draco-sized)
	About as normal as dragons get.
* L- (Human-sized)
	Please, don't step on the tail...
* L-- (Dog-sized)
  Please, don't step on me..."
* L--- (Pocket Dragon-sized or below)
	Please, don't sneeze...
* L---! (Microscopic)
	Honey, I shrunk the dragon!
* L~ (Variable)
	I change size on a whim!
* L^ (One-Dragon-Sized)
	I am just long enough to reach the ground!

### Quantitative method
Alternatively, you can specify your exact weight using one of these tags.

* L[number]i
	You are about that number of inches long (1 inch = 2.54 centimetres). For example, `L480i` indicates: "I am about 480 inches long."
* L[number]f
	You are about that number of feet long (1 foot = 30.5 centimetres). For example, `L40f` indicates: "I am about 40 feet long."
* L[number]y
	You are about that number of yards long (1 yard = 0.914 metres). For example, `L13y` indicates: "I am about 13 yards long."
* L[number]c
	You are about that number of centimetres long (1 centimetre = 0.393 inches). For example `L1220c` indicates: "I am about 1220 centimetres long."
* L[number]m
	You are about that number of metres long (1 metre = 3.28 feet). For example, `L12m` indicates: "I am about 12 metres long."
* L[number]k
	You are about that number of kilometres long (1 kilometre = 0.621 miles). For example, `L0.01k` indicates: "I am about a hundredth of a kilometre long."

Measurements are nose to tail for quadrupeds, snakes, serpents, etc. and are full standing height for bipeds (and others that stand upright). If you are not sure how to measure yourself, take the length from nose to tail tip.

### Modifiers

If you want to be more specific as to your dimensions, you can specify your tail, neck and head, and legs/arms length using these modifiers (which use the same unit of measure as the main length).

* [number]a
	Put after the length, this specifies your arm length (primarilly for bipeds). For example, `L6f2a` indicates: "I am 6 foot tall with arms that are 2 feet long each."
* [number]l
	Put after the length, this specified your leg length. For example, `L30c5l` indicates: "I am 30 centimetres long with 5 centimetre long legs."
* [number]n
	Put after the length, this specifies your neck and head length. For example, `L1k0.2n` indicates: "I am a kilometre in length with a neck and head that are 300 metres in length."
* [number]t
	Put after the length, this specifies your tail length. For example, `L6i2t` indicates: "I am 6 inches long with a 2 inch long tail."
* [number]w
	Put after the length, this specifies your wingspan (wing-tip to wing-tip). For example, `L3i6w` indicates: "I am 3 inches tall with a 6 inch wingspan."

You can also combine modifiers, for example, `L10m4t1l` indicates 'I am 10 metres long with a 4 metre long tail and 1 metre long legs.' For plants, treat the body as the trunk or stem, legs as roots, arms as branches, wings as leaves, and the neck and head as the flower and its stem.


## Width (W*)
There comes a time in a human's life when they stop growing vertically and start to grow horizontally! Well, so do dragons! This tag is a measure of your spread, or lack of it.

* W+++!
  I am Athelind! My belly is now several galaxies wide ... while I'm only a few hundred feet long!
* W+++
  Planets have been known to crack in half with my arrival!
* W++
  My digestion of food has been known to cause earthquakes.
* W+
  I move by rolling. Flying has always been an effort for me.
* W
 What can I say ... I'm normal, except for a few feasts here or there."
* W-
  I'm slightly on the slim side!
* W--
  Ever heard of serpentine?
* W---
  Whoah! Whaddaya mean I look like a long string with wings?"
* W---!
  I'm one-dimensional - all length and no width or depth. Just one long super-string!
* W~ (Variable)
  My girth depends on what I've just eaten!


## Weight / Tonnage (T*)
As well as knowing the dimensions of another dragon, it is also important to know it's weight too, especially if one intends on having it sit on one's lap!

* T+++! (Black-Hole)
  Everything gravitates towards me eventually!
* T+++ (Massive)
  I've been eating rocks again!
* T++ (Obese)
  I'm on a sea-food diet ... I see food and eat it!
* T+ (Over-weight)
  I've been eating too many doughnuts again!
* T (Normal)
  I'm as normal a weight as one gets.
* T- (Under-weight)
  I've not had a good meal for ages!
* T-- (Buoyant)
  I've been breathing helium again!
* T--- (Feather-weight)
  I get blown about by the wind.
* T---! (Weightless)
  I'm made out of gossamer.

### Quantitative method
Alternatively, you can specify your exact weight using one of these tags.

* T[number]c
  You weigh about that number of long hundredweight avoirdupois (1 cwt = 50.8 kilogrammes or 8 stone / 112 pounds). For example, `T16c` indicates: "I am about 16 hundredweight."
* T[number]g
  You weigh about that number of grammes (1 gramme = 0.0353 ounces). For example, `T800000g` indicates: "I am about 800000 grammes."
* T[number]k
  You weigh about that number of kilogrammes (1 kilogramme = 2.205 pounds). For example, `T800k` indicates: "I am about 800 kilogrammes."
* T[number]l
  You weigh about that number of pounds avoirdupois (1 pound = 0.4536 kilogrammes or 16 ounces). For example, `T1800l` indicates "I am about 1800 pounds."
* T[number]o
  You weigh about that number of ounces avoirdupois (1 ounce = 28.35 grammes). For example, `T28700o` indicates: "I am about 28700 ounces."
* T[number]s
  You weigh about that number of stones avoirdupois (1 stone = 6.35 kilogrammes or 14 pounds). For example, `T128s` indicates: "I am about 128 stones."
* T[number]t
  You weigh about that number of tons avoirdupois or metric tonnes (1 ton = 1016 kilogrammes or 2240 pounds, 1 tonne = 2205 pounds or 1000 kilogrammes). It's up to you which one you mean! For example, `T0.8t` indicates: "I am about 0.8 tons."


## Appendages (P*)
This tag describes the numbers of limbs and other appendages on your body. If you have the "obvious" numbers of limbs for a creature of your species you may skip this tag, but "normal" is up for one's own interpretation. It's best to describe them just in case.

* Pa (A pair of arms)
* Pf (A pair of fore-limbs, limbs that can be used as both arms and legs)
* Ph (A head)
* Pk (A crest)
* Pl (A pair of legs)
* Pp (A pair of paddles, flukes, or fins.)
* Pt (A tail)
* Pv (A pair of horns or spines on the head)
* Pw (A pair of wings)
* Pw' (A pair of wings that also act as arms, legs, or fore-limbs)

You can combine the above options together in any you want. For example, `Phwlwllt` indicates that you have a head, a pair of wings, a pair of legs, a pair of wings, then two pairs of legs, and a tail.


### Modifiers

* ^ (Appendage ends in a webbed hand or foot)
	For example, `Pl^` indicates: "Don't call me a frog!"
* \+ (One more than normal)
	For example `Ph+` indicates 'I got ahead in advertising!'
* \- (One less than normal)
	For example `Pw-` indicates 'I have only one wing!'
* ! (I have many of these)
	For example `Pl!` indicates 'I am a millipede!'
* [number] (I have this many of these)
	For example `Pl3l-` indicates 'I am an octopus with a missing leg!'
* ~ (Variable)
	For example, `Pl~` indicates: "I grow legs when I feel the need for them!"

## Skin-Type (Sk*)
What one feels like to the touch is something which can often be nice to know. You can let others know what they're in for by using this tag. If your skin type is what would be considered usual for your species you don't have to use this tag, but what is usual for dragons?

* Skb (Bark)
* Skc (Cellulose)
* Ske (Exoskeleton, e.g. shells, calcium carbonate)
* Skf (Feathers)
* Skh (Hide)
* Skk (Skin)
* Skl (Leather)
* Skm (Metal)
* Skr (Rock, stone)
* Sks (Scales)
* Sku (Fur)
* Skx (Crystals)
* Sk (None, just bones)

### Body parts

* ,a[type] (Arms)
  For example, `Sks,ak` indicates: "My body is scaly, but I have skin on my arms."
* ,b[type] (Belly)
  For example, `Sks,bm` indicates: "My body is scaly, but I have a metal underside."
* ,h[type] (Head)
  For example, `Sku,hf` indicates: "My body is furry, and I have a head of feathers."
* ,l[type] (Legs)
  For example, `Skr,lh` indicates: "My body is rocky, and I have legs of hide."
* ,n[type] (Neck)
  For example, `Skb,nc` indicates: "My body (trunk) has bark, but my neck (flower stem) is cellulose."
* ,t[type] (Tail)
  For example, `Sks,th` indicates: "My body is scaly, but my tail has hide."
* ,w[type] (Wings)
  For example, `Sks,wl` indicates: "My body is scaly, and I have leathery wings."

For plants, treat the body as the trunk or stem, legs as roots, arms as branches, wings as leaves, neck as flower stem, and head as the flower.

## Colouration (C*)
One's colour can be very important to some, especially dragons. This tag has been expanded and revolutionised from the original Colour tag such that you can now specify the colour of almost every part of your body!
* Cag (Silver, argent)
* Cam (Amber)
* Caq (Aquamarine)
* Cau (Gold, aurum)
* Cbk (Black)
* Cbl (Blue)

For plants, treat the body as the trunk or stem, legs as roots, arms as branches, wings as leaves, neck as flower stem, and head as the flower.

## Breath-Weapon (B*)
Quite a few Dragons have been famed for their ability to exhale a stream of fire at their enemies. However there are many other types of Breath-Weapon in use.

The following options are by no means a definitive list and are being added to constantly. However, if you don't see your particular type of breath-weapon listed, you can write it out in "double quotes". For example B"skittles" indicates that you breath skittles — presumably not the ten-pin kind!

* Bac (Acid)
* Bco (Cold or frost)
* Ben (Enchantment)
* Beg (Energy)
* Bfl (Flame or fire)
* Bhe (Heat)
* Bic (Ice)
* Bla (Lava or magma)
* Bph (Photons/Light)
* Bpl (Plasma)
* Bro (Rot)
* Bsm (Smoke)
* Bst (Steam)
* Bsu (Sulphur)
* Bvg (Volcanic gasses, e.g. pyroclastics)
* Bwa (Water)
* Bwi (Wind)
* Bzz (Electricity or lightning)
* B- (No Breath-Weapon)

You can also put the specific type of weapon after the option in "double quotes". For example Bac"sulphuric" indicates that you breathe sulphuric acid.

### Modifiers
* | (Beam)
For example, `Beg|` indicates: "I am a Dalek! Exterminate! Exterminate!"
* \# (Cloud)
For example `Bsm#` indicates: "When I breathe, ships need to use their fog-horns!"
* / (Multiple)
If you have several breath-weapons, you can specify them all using `/` to seperate each one. For example, `Bfl/ac/"chocolate"` indicates: "I breathe fire, acid, and chocolate... anyone for melted acid drops?"


## Age (A*)

Your age is something that can be very personal, or something to be very proud of!

* A+++! (Ancient)
* A+++ (Venerable)
* A++ (Old enough to know better!)
* A+ (You've been around)
* A (Mature Adult)
* A- (Young Adult)
* A--  (Still under your parent's wing)
* A--- (Hatchling)
* A---! (An egg, nearly hatched!)
* A? (I have no idea how old I am, I lost count years ago!)

For reference, human teenagers would be `A-`, `A` would indicate someone in their 20s to mid-30s and every `+` would indicate about another 15 years.

### Modifiers

* r
  Put after the A, this indicates that one is specifying one's "Real Life" age. For example, `Ar-` indicates: "I am a young adult in real life."
* v
  Put after the A, this indicates that one is specifying one's "Virtual Life" age. For example, `Av+` indicates: "I've been around on the internet!"
* ( )
  You can use both of the above in separate tags to specify both ages, but you can also use a short-form method by just putting the `r` and `v` parts within parenthesis. For example, `Ar-Av+` and `A(r-v+)` both indicate: "I am a young adult in real life, but have been around on the net."

## Fruitiness (Fr*)
The very first online meeting place for dragons, and dragon-lovers, was the newsgroup alt.fan.dragons. It's still fondly considered to be home for many. Those who have been there for a while, or who have visibly enriched the newsgroup, or even those just appear to have been there for ages are (jokingly) called "fruits", whilst those still new to the AFD community are referred to as "nuts".

This tag indicates the level of fruitiness, or nuttiness. There are two different standards that you can use, a time based one and an attitude based one. You are free to choose whichever of the two you prefer, and are not at liberty to specify which you have chosen to use!

If you happen to know what sort of fruit or nut you are, you can specify it after the rating in "double quotes". Apparently Baxil (the original maintainer of the code) is a Fr+++"kiwi"!

### Time-based fruitiness

* Fr+++!
  I remember when humans ruled the newsgroup!
* Fr+++
  I remember Dalvenjah posting regularly.
* Fr++
  I've been here for a couple of years or so.
* Fr+

* Fr--
  They're still responding to my welcome post.
* Fr---
  I haven't posted yet, I'm just lurking!
* Fr---!
  I've never heard of AFD!

### Attitude-based fruitiness

* Fr+++!
  I'm too fruity for my hat!)
* Fr+++
  I am well into the fermentation process.
* Fr++
  I have accidentally been used in food fights.
* Fr+
  Friends have spotted me in fruit salads.
* Fr
  Squeeze me! I'm ripe!
* Fr-
  I haven't fallen off the tree yet
* Fr--
  It can be said that I am very a-peel-ing!
* Fr---
  A squirrel tried to hoard me the other day.
* Fr---!
  I'm only a sparkle in the eye of the tree!

 ### Other

  Have joined, left, returned, etc.
* Fr*
  I got flamed off the newsgroup for yelling at Shim!


## Native-Land (N*)
The native territory, or natural habitat, of a creature can be quite important to them. Mant dragons are associated with different types of land, as are many creatures. However, if this tag does not apply to you (as it doesn't for many humanoids) then leave it out altogether. A good rule is that if you feel drawn to more than one of the listed land types, you probably don't have a specific native land.

* Na (Air)
  I live in the clouds!
* Ne (Earth)
  I prefer to dwell underground!
* Nf (Fire)
  I am a child of the flame!
* Ni (Ice)
  I thrive in the cold polar winds and the tundra is my playground!
* Nj (Jungle)
  I only feel happy in the tropical rainforests of my home.
* Nm (Mountains)
  I am only truly happy when surrounded by tall peaks!
* Nn (Nature)

* N^ (Ethereal)
  I exist in the folds of reality!
* N! (Imaginary)
  I am a figment of my imagination!


## Mating-Status (M*)
Sure, there are those lucky/unlucky dragons among us who are mated/tied-down in reality, but what about those who have a Special Someone on-line? Or are looking ... desperately?! Or are hiding from the lookers?!

* M+++!
  I'm mated in real life to my online mate's real life self as well!
* M+++
  Am I mated? Ask my hatchlings!
* M++
  Ask my significant other!
* M+
  Ask my mate-to-be!
* M
  Ask me, and I might just say yes!
* M-
  Don't ask!
* M--
  Ask my poker/football/bridge/Trivial Pursuit buddies!
* M---
  I'm single and very proud of it!
* M---!
  Not only am I single, but I despise the idea of mating.
* M/
  Ask me, and I'll ask your snout to meet your kidneys!

### Modifiers

* [space]
  Put before the plusses (doesn't apply to minuses), this indicates that one is distant from one's mate. For example, `M ++` indicates: "Ask my significant other, who is far from home!"
* [number]
  Put after the plusses, this indicates the number of mates one has. For example, `M++3` indicates: "Ask my three significant others!"
* \|
  Put after the plusses (doesn't apply to minuses) or the number of mates if specified, this indicates that you are separated (e.g. divorced). If you have more than one mate, you should put the number of separated mates after the `|`. For example, `M+++2|1` indicates: "Am I mated? Ask my hatchlings of either of my two mates, one of which I am separated from."
* \*
  Identical to `|` above, except that it indicates one was bitter about it!
* _
  Identical to `|` above, except that it indicates your mate is dead.
* xx
  Put at the end of the tag, this indicates that one is a card-carrying member of the XX Conspiracy!
* xy
  Put at the end of the tag, this indicates that one is a card-carrying member of the XY Conspiracy!
* r
  Put after the M, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Real Life' mating status. For example, `Mr-` indicates: "Don't ask me in real life."
* v
  Put after the M, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Virtual Life' mating status. For example, `Mv+` indicates: "Ask my mate-to-be on the net."
* ( )
  You can use both of the above in separate tags to specify both mating statuses, but you can also use a short-form method by just putting the r and v parts within parenthesis. For example `Mr-Mv+` and `M(r-v+)` both indicate: "Don't ask me in real life, but ask my mate-to-be on the net."


## Offspring (O*)
Many dragons who are mated (and also a few who aren't) have either guarded a clutch or two of eggs or protected some hatchlings against predators (yum yum)! This tag allows you to show how many hatchlings you have raised (or are raising).

* O+++!
  I have many of them, and none of them look like leaving yet!
* O+++
  I have several that haven't fledged yet.
* O++
  I have a couple that have not yet left home.
* O+
  I've got one still in the nest.
* O
  There's just me (and my mate, if applicable).
* O-
  I had one, but they've left home.
* O--
  I had a couple, but they're living their own lives now.
* O---
  I've had several, all successfully fledged.
* O---!
  I've had many, but they've all flown away now.
* O?
  I lost track long ago. If it meeps, I feed it.
* O~
  I have a variable number, depending on who I'm fostering this month!
* O/
  If I ever heard one was my fault, I'd faint!
* O+[number]
  Indicates exactly how many you have and that they've not left home yet.)
* O-[number]
  Indicates exactly how many you have had that have flown the coop.)

### Modifiers

* r
  Put after the `O`, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Real Life' offspring. For example, `Or-` indicates: "I had one in real life, but they left home."
* v
  Put after the `O`, this indicates that one is specifying one's "Virtual Life" offspring. For example, `Ov+` indicates: "I've got one on the 'net, still in the nest."
* ( )
  You can use both of the above in seperate tags to specify both types of offspring, but you can also use a short-form method by just putting the r and v parts within parenthesis. For example, `Or-Ov+` and `O(r-v+)` both indicate: "I had one in real life, but they left home; and I've got one on the 'net, still in the nest."
* a
  Put before any plusses or minuses, this indicates that one is specifying adopted offspring. This can be real or virtual. For example Ova+ indicates "I've got one adopted on the 'net that is still at home."


## Hoard-Size (H*)
This should need little explanation!

* H+++!
  Governments quake when they hear you're going to sell!
* H+++
  You really can't tell when someone steals an item!

* H---
  No money, no lair, at least you aren't starving!
* H---!
  Look on the bright side. At least you've got friends!


## Monetary-Philosophy ($*)

Different dragons, surprisingly, have very different attitudes about their money. This tag allows you to let everyone know what your attitude is.
* $+++!
  All things of value gravitate towards me. When I've got my claws on them I never let go!
* $+++
  The coinage has my likeness on it. I own the whole kingdom!
* $++
  Besides humans, I kill other dragons for their wealth.
* $+
  Investments in human businesses. I do repossessions "CHOMP" personally!

* $---
  I'm a philanthropist. I gave it all to the poor!
* $---!
  I eschew all things of value. I don't need them! Whatever I find I give away.


## Diet (F*)
Most creatures eat something (or feed on something to be more exact). This simply indicates your favourite food groups and how much you tend to eat.

* F+++!   (Insatiable) - 'More! More! More!'
* F+++    (Voracious) - 'At least you don't have to wash up the plates now!'
* F++ (Glutton)

* F-- (Efficient)

* Ff (Fluids)
  Here fishy fishy fish!
* Fj (Junk food addict)
  Chocolate for ME!
* Fm (Mineral-eater)
  I AM the Big Red Rock Eater!
* Fo (Omnivorous)
* Fp (Photosynthesiser)
* Ft (Thaumivore)
"I eat magic for breakfast and mana for tea!
* Fv (Vegetarian)

You can combine the above in any order, for example `F---f` is the same as `Ff---` which indicates: "I live in a desert!" The amount you tend to eat should only appear once and is not related to the food groups.

### Modifiers

* /
  If you eat several things, you can seperate their codes with ``/``. For example `Fv/f` indicates: "I eat and drink normally, but nothing animate!"
* ~
  This indicates that you eat anything. If put after a food group it indicates you eat anything of that type. For example, `Fv~` indicates: "I eat anything vegetable."


## Reality-Index (R*)
Your Reality tag measures how serious you are about your on-line identity in real life. This applies to all species, even humans as one can be very serious about their humanity!

* R+++!
  I AM as I describe myself, and no-one is going to persuade me otherwise. What you see is what your mind wants you to see!
* R+++
  I AM as I describe myself online. The human body is either an unfortunate mismatch, an illusion, or just my messenger.
* R++
  I tend to answer to my on-line name quicker than my given one. I strongly identify with this form. It would explain a lot if I wasn't really human, but I'm hedging my bets.
* R+
  It's a role, but it's a role that's part of my self-image, without which I would feel like something was missing.
* R
  I haven't given much thought to whether I am more "real" in human form or in my on-line identity. I'm just me.
* R-
  It would be nice to be as I say I am on-line, but I've got some real doubts about whether such a thing is possible.
* R--
  This is a hobby for me. My character is just a product of my imagination, nothing more.
* R---
  I consider all of this imaginary. You R+++ people scare me. Don't you think you're taking things a bit too seriously?
* R---!
  I am role-playing. You are role-playing. If you try to correct me on this assumption, I will publicly flame you as insane.
* R*
  Don't ask, don't tell.
* R?
  The thought just hasn't crossed my mind!


## Activity-Index (Ac*)
Everyone spends different amounts of time on-line, and it can be nice to know just when you're likely to see someone again. This tag allows you to specify just that! Take the following descriptions as rough guides rather than hard and fast rules.
* Ac+++!
  I have a T1 connection and am never off the 'net! I even order pizza across it!
* Ac+++
  This is my home! I spend as many waking moments as possible online.
* Ac++
  I'm online every day for about eight hours or so!
* Ac+
  I'm on-line for at least two hours every day!
* Ac
  I get on every day, briefly, to check my mail and the newsgroups.
* Ac-
  "I only get on occasionally during the week, but am here every weekend.
* Ac--
 I can barely manage to connect once a week.
* Ac---
  I'm lucky if I get online once a month!
* Ac---!
  If you see me, it must be raining frogs again!
* Ac~
  I go online when I feel like it. It may be hours, it may be months!
* Ac?
  I really don't know when I'll be online again!


## Humour-Index (Joviality) (J*)
So! You're about to play this really weird prank on another Dragon involving sparklies and superglue ... but you're not sure how they're going to take it? Well this tag will let you know just that!

* J+++!
  Everything is a joke. I find something to laugh at everywhere I look... and that includes you!
* J+++
  There's very little I won't laugh about... and very little I won't do to make you laugh!
* J++
  Laughing is just so good for you! Even when you're being serious about something it's good to slip in the odd joke!
* J+
  I appreciate humour of all kinds, but I do know when to take things seriously.
* J
  I laugh at many things, but there's a time and a place for joking.
* J-
  A joke a day keeps depression at bay... but laughing out loud is bad for my health!
* J--
  Some things are OK to laugh at, but many things are not. I'll take whatever you say seriously unless you put those cute little smileys by it!
* J---
  I can't think of the time when I last laughed.
* J---!
  Jokes, frivolity, they're all just works of the Devil!

### Modifiers

* r
  Put after the `J`, this indicates that one is specifying one's 'Real Life' humour index. For example, `Jr-` indicates "I laugh occasionally in real life."
* v
  Put after the `J`, this indicates that one is specifying one's "Virtual Life" humour index. For example, `Jv+` indicates "I goof around a bit on the 'net!"
* ( )     You can use both of the above in seperate tags to specify both humour indices, but you can also use a short-form method by just putting the r and v parts within parenthesis. For example, `Jr-Jv+` and `J(r-v+)` both indicate: "I don't really find much humour in real life, but I do appreciate jokes on the net."


## Social-Life (S*)
Some creatures live in secret, but many are open to the world about it. This element describes how open you are to the human world about your involvement with your online persona.

* S+++!
  I have made a determined effort to advertise the fact that I'm not a human. My close friends have got used to explaining me to strangers to save them time. I'm so militant about my true identity that even the men in white coats were impressed!
* S+++
  My friends' parents all know. I use my on-line name in front of total strangers regularly. I've received letter from people I've never met asking questions about how to deal with being non-human.
* S++
  All of my friends know. I told my parents instead of waiting for them to find out. The local cybercaf&eacute;'s manager calls me by my online name.
* S+
  Most of my friends know. I'd tell my parents if I thought they'd take it well. I've used my on-line name in public on occasion.
* S
  A few of my friends know. I'm glad my parents have never asked me about this. I'm rather low-key but don't dodge the subject.
* S-
  I don't want to be thought crazy in human life. If the subject came up, I'd tell my closest friends only.
* S--
  It's something that would make me rather uncomfortable to have let out. I'm open online but try to keep my human side untraceable, and vice versa.
* S---
  I've e-mailed only a few kindred souls I think I can trust, not telling them anything about my human life, naturally. There are great advantages to my continued silence.
* S---!
  No on knows, period. I live in fear that my intolerant neighbours, colleagues, or relatives will turn me over to the Thought Police! I post only under condition of anonymity. I'm going out on a limb even assembling my Dragon Code!


## Ubiquity (U*)
Many dragons have a long and noteworthy history going back hundreds, or even thousands, of years. Long before dealing with the daily grind of this human society they were shaping history! This tag shows how much you have done prior to making yourself known in the dragon community. It also shows how much of it you can remember!

* U+++!
  They call me 'The Vanisher'. Odd Beholder creatures that I only vaguely remember are still fighting holy wars over me. I've lost track of the number of planets my friends and I have personally shaped the history of. I'm not a god!
* U+++
  Not only do I remember most of my dozens (or hundreds) of past lives, but I remember a few things about you too!
* U++
  See that book over there? I wrote that in a different life!
* U+
  I can remember several past-life names, and am occasionally recognised too!
* U
  I've done some soul-searching, and got real results! This isn't my first time around.
* U-
  I'm pretty sure I've done something important, sometime, but I haven't got much of a clue as to what it was.
* U--
  When I tried to do a past-life regression, I got a '404 Not found - Access denied'. Why don't past lives come with search engines?
* U---
  Whatever it was I did, it made me end up here. I don't want to look!
* U---!
  I blocked out my memories in self-defence after the incident with the Trout farm, the Spell of Growth, and the women's locker room at the Magic Academy! Total strangers occasionally give me odd looks and move to the other side of the street as I pass.
* U?
  What's a past life?
* U!
  This is my first life!
* U*
  I've been around a bit, I'm just not saying how many times!
* U2
  My name is Bono! :8)


## Irritability (I*)
  This tag should be considered vital - it indicates those you can have fun with and those you should be wary of!

* I+++!
  You're just not going to catch me in a good mood! Live with it or you'd better like barbeque!

## Magical-Ability / Voodoo (V*)
Magical prowess is often associated with dragons, not least in the ability to shape change or to ride the winds, but in other forms as well. This tag indicates how adept you are in the arcane arts.

* V+++!
  I have reached the pinnacle of my profession.
* V+++
  I'm reasonably adept in my field.
* V++
  I know a number of spells.
* V+
  I can perform a few cantrips with candles.
* V
  Magic is something I've never really looked into.
* V-
  Magicians worry when I'm near.
* V--
  Most magic seems to fail when I'm nearby!
* V---
  Only a few spells seem to have an effect, but that could just be psychological.
* V---!
  Magic? What's that?

It may look as though this tag shows two abilities, but this is not so. If one has no magical ability, but prevents magic occurring around one then one uses the minuses. However if one has magical ability then you would tend to use that to prevent magic from occurring, thus you would use the pluses.

### Modifiers

* [field]
  If you really feel it is necessary, you can specify your specialist field within square brackets. For example, `V++[fire]` indicates: "I know a number of spells of fire magic."

## Psy-Power (Q*)
You may not know it, but there are those who can read your mind like a magazine, or move objects just by thinking. You can indicate your strength in Psionics using this tag.

* Q+++!

* Q-

* Q---!
  Not only am I immune to any Psionic effect, but I prevent them happening around me as well.
  
As for Magical-Ability, this tag looks like it represents two seperate abilities. However one will only use the minuses if one has no psionic ability (but still resists psionics), and the plusses if one has psionic ability (it is assumed you resist with your own psionics).

### Modifiers
