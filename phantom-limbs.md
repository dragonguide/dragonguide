# Supernumerary phantom limbs
Supernumerary phantom limbs, often referred to as simply phantom limbs, are a neurological phenomenon in which individuals experience sensations of having extra limbs that do not physically exist. Unlike typical phantom limb experiences, which involve the sensation of a missing limb, supernumerary phantom limbs involve the perception of additional limbs or features beyond the normal human anatomy.
